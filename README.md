## WARNING!!!
I've been noticing some problems generating the dex file. Just a heads up if a pokemon is reported missing but the file is correct
I increased dex accuracy hopefully that fixes bugs

Notes with this version: There are problems with the dex file hopefully I don't have to revert to legacy method of finding should be working now
